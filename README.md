There are still more features to be added/bug fixes, but this is a milestone. Will work on it some more at a future point, just a little burned out with TicTacToe (I get burned out easily)
But currently, you can compile it into an executable Jar file, and you can play PvP or Player vs Easy mode (which randomly chooses)
The Minimax algorithm has an annoying bug I need to fix, but it's gonna take longer than I have time for.
Compile it with mvn clean compile assembly:single
